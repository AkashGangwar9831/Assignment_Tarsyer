1. Implemented a classifier based on the trained Autoencoder and CNN in which the input is a noisy number and the output is a denoised number using MNIST dataset. Also used Gaussian distribution to add noise to the input. Plotted the training & validation loss.

2.  Implemented a basic neural network in which small number of training inputs is chosen in each batch and each data sample is processed once and the error for each sample is accumulated. Following this, back propagation is invoked.
